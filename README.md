# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository

I'm starting freeCodeCamp, and the first lesson was to come here and create an account.  I already had one, but I have not used it before.
I have been working with computers for longer than I care to admit, and I have done some work related coding and scripting. I have been a generalist jack of all trades.  I'm interested in deepening my programing skills and finding a full time progamming/developer position.
